Joe is an expert at attacking Windows networks using PowerShell and has contributed numerous PowerShell scripts to the <a href="https://github.com/mattifestation/PowerSploit">PowerSploit</a> project in an effort to raise awareness of the PowerShell attack vector. Joe also has experience auditing PowerShell scripts for security issues (and exploiting these issues), as well as applying PowerShell best practices to help secure networks. Joe maintains a blog where he discusses interesting post-exploitation techniques, often involving PowerShell, at <a href="http://clymb3r.wordpress.com">http://clymb3r.wordpress.com</a>. Joe is also interested in rock climbing, mountain biking, snowboarding, and auto racing.
