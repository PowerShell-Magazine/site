Keith Hill has been a software developer on Windows since 1992 using C, Objective C, C++ and C#.  I am a veteran of many Microsoft PDC’s with eight under my belt (93,96,97,00,03, 05, 08, 10 and BUILD 2011). At the 2003 PDC, I sat in on session about the future of Windows administration and automation. That was the first public peek at Monad and I’ve been hooked on PowerShell ever since.
