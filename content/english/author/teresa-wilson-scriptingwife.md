Teresa Wilson was born and raised on a farm in rural Kentucky and later retired after working in the accounting field. She is married to the Microsoft Scripting Guy, Ed Wilson. She started learning Windows PowerShell in 2010 for the Scripting Games. She thought it would be fun and maybe would encourage others to learn PowerShell also. In her free time she is an avid reader and loves to visit with others in the PowerShell community. She is the booking agent for the guests on the PowerScripting podcast and can usually be found hanging out in the chatroom on Thursday evenings. Her latest adventure is helping PowerShell MVP Jim Christopher start the Charlotte PowerShell Users Group.
