Jason has been a developer on the Microsoft platform for over 15 years, with a regular tendency to cross in to the infrastructure space. This year Jason took a new job to work with the Linux platform full-time instead. His passion for PowerShell however keeps him coming back to Windows in his spare time, albeit with a fresh perspective.
