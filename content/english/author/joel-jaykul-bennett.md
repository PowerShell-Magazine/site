Joel Bennett has been writing software and blogging about it since high school, and has been working as a software developer at Xerox for 15 years. Constantly playing with computers in his free time, he's worked on everything from open source Windows Shell replacements (geoShell) and WordPress plugins, to WPF UI Modules (ShowUI) and graphical consoles (PoshConsole) for PowerShell. He blogs at HuddledMasses.org and runs PoshCode.org, and somewhere along the line he earned a Microsoft MVP award.
