Windows PowerShell team [just announced][1] the availability of [WMF 5.0 Preview May 2014 release][2]. This includes an exciting new feature called PowerShellGet.

PowerShellGet is a new way to discover, install, and update PowerShell Modules.  New in WMF 5.0 Preview May 2014, PowerShellGet contains a set of cmdlets that enable users to interact with an online module gallery.

If you have not tried WMF 5.0 Preview yet, it includes a new package management framework called OneGet and good [number of changes/fixes to Desired State Configuration][3]. I will write here about some more changes to DSC soon. So, watch this space.

Go ahead and try WMF 5.0 Preview.
