[PowerShell Conference Asia 2015][1] is coming up fast so here’s a quick update on all the incredible speakers we’ve got lined up already.

After we sent out the call for speakers and sponsors we had an awesome response. We’ve had community members, MVPs and even the PowerShell Product Team put their hand up to be there and present the latest and greatest in PowerShell to you.

Now that we’re rapidly approaching the second half of the year a lot of people have been contacting us keen to know how they can register. We’ve been really overwhelmed with interest and support from the whole APAC Community, so thank you for that.

Here’s an overview of the current arrangements and plans

### Platinum Sponsor

SAPIEN have long supported the PowerShell community and make some of the best tools on the market. With amazing folks like Ferdinand Rios, David Corrales, and June Blender, SAPIEN are hugely influential in the PowerShell community. We can&#8217;t thank them enough for helping to make this event happen. SAPIEN will be present for both days and we look forward to welcoming them.
