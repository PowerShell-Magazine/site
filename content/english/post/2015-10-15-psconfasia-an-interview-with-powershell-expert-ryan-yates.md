We concluded the first exclusive PowerShell conference in Asia a couple of weeks ago. It was very successful and there are already plans to take this conference around APAC region. We have had PowerShell expertsÂ from around the world joining us as speakers at this conference. I had the chance to sit with some of them and talk to them about PowerShell, of course!

Today, Ryan Yates talks to us about how he started with PowerShell, PowerShell community and his experience at the PowerShell Conference Asia!
