Today, we are very happy to announce the launch of PowerShellMagazine.com – a magazine dedicated to Windows PowerShell.

What an exciting journey this was! A while ago, I started with this thought of a magazine for PowerShell specific content. I sketched the outline I thought was good and shared those details with [Aleksandar][1] Nikolic. Being a great technical reviewer, Aleksandar is very keen on details. He refined the outline I’d proposed and we were ready to start the “real” work. We got some great minds from the PowerShell community with us. We invited [Doug Finke][2], [Robert Robelo][3], [Shay Levy][4], and [Steven Murawski][5] to be a part of the founding team and [editor’s panel][6]. After less than two months, we just did the website launch and are working hard to release the first edition in October.

The launch of the website is just the beginning. We are not done yet and will continue to refine the look and feel of the site. You will see us posting lot of “online only” content that may not get into the first edition of PowerShell Magazine. You can take a tour of the website&#8217;s content using the navigation menu just below the magazine logo or tag cloud in the sidebar. We will make sure to keep this interactive by posting brainteasers, quizzes, and many more!

We have also enabled simplified UI for the mobile devices such as iPhone, etc. We will enable many more features in the coming days for better portable device experience.
