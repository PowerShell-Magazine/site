The heat is on! The 3rd annual German PowerShell Community conference is taking place in Essen/Ruhr April 22 and 23. Hosted on the venue of the Philharmonics in Essen, Germany, twelve international speakers celebrate a very special and very passionate PowerShell happening with you.

Speakers include Bruce Payette, Tobias Weltner, Bartek Bielawski, Jeff Wouters, Holger Schwichtenberg, Peter Monadjemi, Aleksandar Nikolic, and many other well-known experts. With 6 MVPs, three book authors, and a PowerShell team member locked into one conference venue, you&#8217;ll likely enjoy the highest concentration of PowerShell wizardry on one spot in the better known part of this universe.

This year, the conference presents the state-of-the-art of the PowerShell ecosystem. You will be amazed what can be done with the existing PowerShell, and what the great features (and use cases) are in the upcoming PowerShell 5.0.

Presentations cover top notch topics such as security and JEA (&#8220;Just Enough Admin&#8221;), Desired State Configuration deep dives, new class support, and amazing example-based parsing found in PowerShell 5.0. Product-based solutions cover Active Directory troubleshooting, Exchange, Lync, SharePoint, and virtualization. And thanks to OMI and OData, you&#8217;ll see how PowerShell even leverages non-Windows systems such as Linux and devices such as network switches.

As always, there is plenty of room to connect to the speakers or fellow attendees, exchange scripting secrets, how-tos, personal best practices, and get to know each other at the evening event and the script hackathon. Since this is a German event (most presentations are held in German), if you are not from a German-speaking country, it is recommended that you have at least a _read-only_ German language skill level and practice how to ask for a cold German beer in native tongue for the evening event.

Conference organizer Dr. Tobias Weltner: &#8220;The table is set. We established a high class German PowerShell event for anyone to come up, talk, and exchange ideas, and lined up great speakers and unique presentations with real-world relevance. The beer is cold, we are ready for action. Now it&#8217;s your turn, we&#8217;d like to see at least every larger German company sending a representative: to get firsthand information, and carry a real big bucket of knowledge and inspiration back home to their companies and colleagues.&#8221; With Bruce Payette, a highly renowned PowerShell team member, attendees would also have the most direct connection to the PowerShell team to answer questions and take feedback, Weltner added. &#8220;Now it&#8217;s up to you to keep such a special event in Germany, and support it with your attendance. Get up, register, and come join the fun!&#8221;

As a Community event, all speakers volunteer. The registration fees pay the venue, the equipment, and catering (drinks and meals, including dinner and the evening event with a selection of truly inspiring drinks).

There is a preconference day (April 21) with a separate basic and advanced workshop for those who want to polish their PowerShell knowledge or get a big scoop of advanced training prior to enjoying the conference presentations. Preconference workshops are separate events, and there is separate registration for them.

At the end of the conference, all attendees receive a uniquely branded USB stick plus all presentations and materials along with a picture set of conference impressions.
