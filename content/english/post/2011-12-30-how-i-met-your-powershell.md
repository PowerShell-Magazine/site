### The Confession

Hi.&nbsp; My name is Josh and:

  1. I love PowerShell and what it enables me to do.
  2. I have not always used PowerShell

While neither of these confessions is an Earth shattering revelation I would not have been able to make these statements 4 years ago.&nbsp; The truth is, I had no interest in PowerShell when I first heard about it. I thought it looked cool.&nbsp; I heard some of the cool kids were doing it but I’m usually not one to succumb to peer-pressure so I put it aside for another day and stuck with my DOS and VBScript.&nbsp; In a funny way though, I was already well on my way to being a PowerShell scripter.

### The Chance Meeting

During 2006 and 2007 I was spending more and more time writing applications with VB.net in Visual Studio.&nbsp; Learning object oriented programming and complex workflows was challenging but I was progressively improving and creating more advanced applications with the guidance of an excellent coworker.&nbsp; All was well until one day I was hit with a difficult realization.&nbsp; We were about to upgrade to Exchange 2007 and it REQUIRED the use of PowerShell!

Fortunately the great Douglas Adams had educated me well in the ways of the universe.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t Panic!&nbsp; During the project I began to pick up little pieces of PowerShell here and there.&nbsp; I learned the amazing cmdlet of Get-Help which I still use DAILY. Understanding of the pipeline started to click but the real magic started to happen when I began to grasp the fact that PowerShell was using objects&#8230;Just like .Net! <cue trumpets…Wait. Hold the music>

Some of the folks on our team were farther ahead than others [not me] but we all began to see the Power in PowerShell.&nbsp; The Exchange upgrade project went well.&nbsp; We used our necessary cmdlets, and even created a few one-liners to pull information from time to time.&nbsp; PowerShell hit the shelf once more.

If you are scratching your head right now I don&#8217;t blame you.&nbsp; It&#8217;s almost like getting the keys to a Tardis and saying, &#8220;I think I just want to head to the pub down the street for a pint.&#8221;&nbsp; Don&#8217;t Panic! PowerShell re-entered my life soon after like a stranger you know you&#8217;ve met and talked to before, but neither of you recall when or where you met.

### When Josh Met PowerCLI

Our reintroduction came with VMware&#8217;s PowerCLI and we&#8217;ve been best buddies ever since.&nbsp; While at the same firm I began to latch onto VMware&#8217;s technology like toddler to a tribble.&nbsp; What VMware could do was amazing and our environment started to multiply right before my eyes.&nbsp; When we just had a handful of physical systems management was kept to a minimum.&nbsp; Since a former manager had introduced VMware into our environment the capabilities of our department increased dramatically.

This expansion soon meant we had more management concerns on our hands.&nbsp; PowerCLI allowed me to quickly run audits on license counts of our VMs, check health and performance, automate VM snapshots and more.&nbsp; While most of the work was still done in vCenter I had finally found that common thread that got me hooked on PowerShell.&nbsp; It was also around this time I had the opportunity to really test myself in a much larger environment.

### Getting Serious

My relationship with PowerShell started to become very serious when I took a role as resident virtualization guru with another company.&nbsp; I was now responsible for hundreds of VMs with several projects coming up requiring significant environment changes.&nbsp; I quickly went to work leading some re-architecture and writing increasingly complex scripts for configuring host networking, migrating VMs, and deploying custom attributes for system ownership.&nbsp; I continued to learn much and more about PowerCLI and PowerShell through the VMware Community forums, following a variety of blogs, and checking out Hal Rottenberg&#8217;s Managing VMware with PowerCLI book.

### The Commitment

In mid-2011 I was offered an opportunity to work for a company whose customer had a pretty large and in charge environment.&nbsp; We&#8217;re talking VMs in the thousands and systems all over the place.&nbsp; I felt I was taking another logarithmic step.&nbsp; I later learned that my experience with PowerCLI was a skill that had set me apart. It didn&#8217;t take long for me to feel like Nero must have felt when he first plugged back into the matrix.&nbsp; Now my scripting was meeting needs at a scale I hadn&#8217;t considered.&nbsp; It was overwhelming and exciting!

It was at this point that I had a little bit of a misstep, as I may have pushed myself a bit too hard. I wasn&#8217;t getting a lot of sleep, I was overworking myself, and overall my heath took a bit of a hit.

I thought myself for a good long while, about what I was doing wrong, and how to turn it around. I had a few good theories on things to try, so I went about them as I was able to. I checked online to see [what is the best&nbsp;mattress&nbsp;in a box][1], and found a good one I could afford. With a new, and very comfortable mattress, I had no issues falling asleep. From there the rest of the pieces fell into place and I was able to pick myself back up and become a contributor to the team.

Being a quick contributor to the team was very satisfying. There were already a couple of people with some solid scripting chops on the team.&nbsp; It was an amazing feeling being able to share my work with others and to give and get help from a team.&nbsp; It was also about this time I decided to start working harder to share my work with the community.

### The Community

It did not take me long to realize that I was repeating a considerable amount of effort in our scripts.&nbsp; I started working hard on developing advanced functions to meet various needs that showed up regularly.&nbsp; The scripting work we&#8217;re now migrating towards can almost be described as modular as we develop functions and snippets that can be reused at will.&nbsp; Advanced functions have become my mistress and this new work has required me to reach out for more advanced resources when needing assistance.

The PowerShell and PowerCLI community is amazing.&nbsp; The folks who blog and participate in the forums and Twitter are a wealth of information.&nbsp; There are some real River Tam&#8217;s out there that do amazing and scary things with PowerShell.&nbsp; The best part is that each and every one of them gets as excited about solving new problems with PowerShell as you and me.&nbsp; I trust that if you&#8217;ve read this far there is no argument on that last point.&nbsp; I have a long list of upcoming posts talking about a variety of issues I&#8217;ve solved that I can&#8217;t wait to share.

The last 6 months have been an amazing time in my PowerShell relationship.&nbsp; I now have my PowerCLI session open constantly.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve become a PowerShell first thinker and find myself solving a variety of problems with different cmdlets and scripts.&nbsp; Many of these little tidbits I share on my blog or on twitter while PowerShell podcasts have even become a weekly ritual (PowerScripting Podcast is a staple).&nbsp; I&#8217;m getting hooked on this PowerShell stuff!&nbsp; In fact, PowerShell and PowerCLI have become important enough for me to take a few hours out of my life to tell you all about our story together&#8230;so far.

If you’re new to PowerShell then Welcome! I hope my story has provided you with an outline of how I grew with PowerShell over the last few years and resources I’ve used along the way.&nbsp; If you’re a veteran then I’d bet we have some similarities in our growing relationship with PowerShell.&nbsp; I’d love to talk to all of you about stuff you’re working on and vice versa.&nbsp; I’m looking forward to reading your stories in this series as well! Cheers and May the –force be with you!
