Hello everyone! The Brain Teaser series continues.

First, we would like to announce the winner of the previous brain teaser. We got a number of very interesting and creative solutions. The shortest answer — [Net.DNS]::GetHostAddresses(&#8220;&#8221;), with 31 characters — was given by _sahal_. So, he is the winner!

Congratulations sahal, you get an eBook version of <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/microsoft-windows-powershell-3-0-firstlook/book" target="_blank">Microsoft Windows PowerShell 3.0 First Look</a> written by <a href="http://csharpening.net/" target="_blank">Adam Driscoll</a> and published by <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/" target="_blank">Packt</a>.

We would like to thank <a href="http://huddledmasses.org/" target="_blank">Joel &#8216;Jaykul&#8217; Bennett</a> for the new brain teaser.

You have an array of words: &#8216;Hannah&#8217;,&#8217;Jeffrey&#8217;,&#8217;12321&#8242;,&#8217;Madam&#8217;,&#8217;Abracadabra&#8217;. Your new task is to output only palindromic words.

The input is: &#8216;Hannah&#8217;,&#8217;Jeffrey&#8217;,&#8217;12321&#8242;,&#8217;Madam&#8217;,&#8217;Abracadabra&#8217;

The output is:

Hannah

12321

Madam

Once again, the shortest answer wins! Be aware, a space is a character too.
