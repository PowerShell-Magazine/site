PowerShell MVP [Yusuf Ozturk][1] released a project he&#8217;s been working on lately &#8211; [PoSHStats v1.1][2]. PoSHStats is the first free and open source reporting tool of Hyper-V resource metering. PoSHStats runs on your Hyper-V server to get detailed statistics like CPU, memory, disk, and bandwidth usage of your virtual machines. It&#8217;s possible to get daily, weekly, and monthly usage statistics of virtual machines. It also gets hourly performance data of your Hyper-V host to monitor your virtualization environment.

Installation of [PoSHStats ][2]is very easy and doesn&#8217;t require additional software. Give it a try!
