Some of you have noticed that the CTP Workflow PDF guide that was a part of PowerShell 3.0 CTP download is no longer available. The content of the guide is now incorporated into the <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj134242" target="_blank">Workflow documentation on TechNet</a>.  Keep an eye open on this space as more and more new stuff will be added there.

Haven&#8217;t started with Workflows yet? Here are a few related posts on the PowerShell team blog:

  * [When Windows PowerShell Met Workflow][1]
  * [High Level Architecture of Windows PowerShell Workflow (Part 1)][2]
  * [High Level Architecture of Windows PowerShell Workflow (Part 2)][3]

And a video with Bruce Payette, about PowerShell Workflows in PowerShell v3 (from the 2011 Deep Dive conference in Frankfurt, Germany)
