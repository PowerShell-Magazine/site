PowerShell Conference Asia 2019 edition will be in Bangalore, India. We closed our [CFP](https://www.powershellmagazine.com/2018/12/31/powershell-conference-asia-2019-call-for-papers-2/) towards end of February and finalized (partially) a great set of International PowerShell Experts. This conference, as always, will feature PowerShell product team members from Redmond. 

Conference website is updated to feature the confirmed speakers and this list includes experts from the USA, Australia, Europe, and India. As I write this, we are yet to finalize a few more speakers and I am sure we will have a fully loaded agenda for all three days. The pre-conf workshops include content from level 100 (PowerShell 101) to CI / CD for PowerShell professionals. On the pre-conf day, there is a track dedicated for deep-dive sessions for the attendees who are already comfortable writing PowerShell scripts and modules. 

At this point in time, we have opened the early bird discount sale (15% on the original ticket price). The tickets are priced in INR and a 3 day pass at this point in time costs less than 100 USD.

You can get the 3 day (includes pre-conf day) early bird pass @ https://imjo.in/N8t8G7 and the 2 day (only full-conf days) early bird pass @
