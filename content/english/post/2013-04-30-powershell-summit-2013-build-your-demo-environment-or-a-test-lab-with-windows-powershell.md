I&#8217;ve had a pleasure to speak at PowerShell Summit North America 2013. I would like to thank the organizers, all attendees&#8211;amazing, passionate PowerShellers who made this event such a huge success, Microsoft and PowerShell team, and a few generous individuals who helped me to be a part of an unforgettable experience.
