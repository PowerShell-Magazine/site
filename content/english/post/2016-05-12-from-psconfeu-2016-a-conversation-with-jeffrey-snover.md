This post is a bit delayed, but PowerShell Conference Europe 2016 was a blast. It&#8217;s a true global conference with both attendees and speakers from four different continents. I had initially planned to record several interviews with speakers at this conference but unfortunately could not do that. Fortunately, I made up for that by recording an interview with [Jeffrey Snover][1]. This interview is over 31 minutes and I really enjoyed talking to Jeffrey.

Jeffrey needs no introduction and we directly go to the questions that we always wanted to ask. In this video, heÂ talked about PowerShell, System Center, Azure Stack, and the future forward!
