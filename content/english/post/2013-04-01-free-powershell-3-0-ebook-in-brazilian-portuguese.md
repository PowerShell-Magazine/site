[Daniel Donda][1],  Windows Expert-IT Pro MVP, has released a new PowerShell eBook written in Brazilian Portuguese. [_Windows PowerShell 3.0 for IT Pro_][2] is an eBook written with infrastructure administrators in mind.

The author felt the need to write this eBook because he thought that most Windows PowerShell publications have an inclination to developer’s concepts.

This eBook tries another approach using many examples that the author hopes will help with the adoption of Windows PowerShell scripting to automate Windows server administration.
