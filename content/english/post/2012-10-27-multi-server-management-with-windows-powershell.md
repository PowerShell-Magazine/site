These videos were released yesterday on YouTube. They are part of theÂ [Windows Server 2012 Jump Start video series published on Microsoft TechNet][1].

In the following two-part module on Multi-Server Management Rick Claus and Corey Hynes focus on demo-rich conversations on essential features like Server Manager, PowerShell w/ ISE, Remote Management Tools and Remote Deployment.

There&#8217;s one word you&#8217;ll hear a lot in these videos. I guess you already know what that word is. ðŸ™‚
