The [Public APIs repository on GitHub](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) has a list of free APIs that you can use in software and web development. This is a great resource for finding out if there is a free public API for a specific task at hand. For example, if your application requires weather data, you can take a look at several [free API options available](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis#weather) and select the one that works for you. I have been following this repository and they have recently added something useful &#8212; a [public API to query for public APIs](https://api.publicapis.org/)! 

I quickly created a new PowerShell module that wraps around the public API for the public APIs!

You can install this [module from the gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PSPublicAPI/)  as well.

```powershell
Install-Module -Name PSPublicAPI -Force
```

There are four commands in this module.

**Get-PSPublicAPICategory** Gets a list of categories for the public API.

**Get-PSPublicAPIHealth** Gets the health state of public API service.

**Get-PSPublicAPIEntry** Gets specific APIs or all API entries from the public API service.

**Get-PSPublicAPIRandomEntry** Gets a random API entry public API service or a random API entry matching a specific criteria.

The commands are pretty much self-explained and you can find the docs for each command [here](https://github.com/rchaganti/PSPublicAPI/tree/master/docs).
