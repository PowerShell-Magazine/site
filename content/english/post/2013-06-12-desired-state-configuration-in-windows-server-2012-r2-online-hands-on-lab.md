I am sure you all must have already looked at the Desired State Configuration (DSC) feature [announcement by Jeffrey Snover and Kenneth Hansen][1] at TechEd 2013. This exciting change is coming up in Windows Server 2012 R2 and with PowerShell version 4. But, none of these are available yet for a public preview.

But, we can&#8217;t wait to explore more on this, right?

So, [here][2] is a chance to get your hands on DSC. Microsoft released an [online hands on lab for Desired State Configuration][2] in Windows Server 2012. Go, explore!
