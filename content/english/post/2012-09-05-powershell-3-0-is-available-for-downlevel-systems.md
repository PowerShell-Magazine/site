[Windows Management Framework 3.0][1] was released yesterday. It includes updated management functionality for Windows 7 Service Pack 1, Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1, and Windows Server 2008 Service Pack 2 (Windows Vista, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 are not supported). Windows Management Framework 3.0 contains Windows PowerShell 3.0 and the new versions of WMI and WinRM.

WMF 3.0 requires Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0, you can download it at: <http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=212547>

A link to the download page is also available in the Downloads sidebar, on the right hand side menu of the magazine&#8217;s homepage.

You can install WMF 3.0 over PowerShell 2.0. In case you have a pre-release version of PowerShell 3.0 installed already, you need to remove it before the installation of WMF3.0.

**Note**: WMF 3.0 is a part of Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 operating systems.
