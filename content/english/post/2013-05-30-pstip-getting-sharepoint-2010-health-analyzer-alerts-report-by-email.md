SharePoint 2010 administrators are probably familiar with the following screenshot&#8211;you open the Central Administration page and you&#8217;re presented with a red Health Analyzer alert.

Clicking the &#8216;View these issues&#8217; link takes you to a page that lists all items that needs an attention.

Checking the health alerts page each day can be a daunting task and you might also forget to do so. To avoid that, and to enable multiple team members to be aware of the alerts, you can Â send the alerts by email. The Health list view (All Reports) is configured to list all items with a Severity not equal to Success (4).

Using the following code, you can read all items, and generate an email that you can send to your team members. Put it in a daily scheduled task on the SharePoint server and you&#8217;re good to go.

```
if ($PSVersionTable) {$Host.Runspace.ThreadOptions = 'ReuseThread'}
Add-PSSnapin Microsoft.SharePoint.PowerShell -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# get the health reports list
$ReportsList = [Microsoft.SharePoint.Administration.Health.SPHealthReportsList]::Local
$FormUrl = '{0}{1}?id=' -f $ReportsList.ParentWeb.Url, $ReportsList.Forms.List.DefaultDisplayFormUrl

$body = $ReportsList.Items | Where-Object {$_['Severity'] -ne '4 - Success'} | ForEach-Object {
    New-Object PSObject -Property @{
        Url = "&lt;a href='$FormUrl$($_.ID)'&gt;$($_['Title'])&lt;/a&gt;"
        Severity = $_['Severity']
        Category = $_['Category']
        Explanation = $_['Explanation']
        Modified = $_['Modified']
        FailingServers = $_['Failing Servers']
        FailingServices = $_['Failing Services']
        Remedy = $_['Remedy']
    }
} | ConvertTo-Html | Out-String

# creating clickable HTML links
$body = $body -replace '&lt;','&lt;' -replace '&gt;','&gt;' -replace '&quot;','"'
$params = @{
	To = 'you@domain.com','manager@domain.com'
	From = 'SPHealth@domain.com'
	Subject = 'Daily Health Analyzer report'
	SmtpServer = 'smtp1'
	Body = $body
	BodyAsHtml = $true
}
Send-MailMessage @params
```

This is how it looks in Outlook (partial view).
