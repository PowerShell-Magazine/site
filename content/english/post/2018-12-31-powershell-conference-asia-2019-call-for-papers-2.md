We announced back in October that the next edition of PowerShell Conference Asia will be hosted in Bangalore (India) and is scheduled to happen from 19th to 21st September 2019.

Like the previous year, we will have a day-long pre-conference workshops this year too. In addition to that, we are introducing pre-conference deep dive talks. While the workshops are targeted more towards the beginners, the pre-conference deep dive talks are meant for those of you who are already at level 150 or 200.

The main conference starts on 20th September 2019. The two days of this conference will have exciting in-depth talks by experts from across the world.

Today, we are announcing the [call for papers (CFP)](https://www.papercall.io/psconfasia2019) to invite interested speakers from around the world to share their knowledge at PowerShell Conference Asia 2019. If you have some exciting work that you want to share with a larger international PowerShell community, this is your chance. Go ahead and submit your session proposals. We will be closing the CFP by end of February. 

If you are a PowerShell beginner or interested in networking with the international community of PowerShell experts and the PowerShell product team from Microsoft, stay tuned for our blind/early bird ticket sales that will start very soon.
