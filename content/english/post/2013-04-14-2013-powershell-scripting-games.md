Mark your calendars. Registrations for the 2013 Scripting Games begin on April 22. To get a better understanding of how the games work this year (hosted on [PowerShell.org][1]), start by reading the [2013 Competitor&#8217;s Guide][2]. If you plan to participate in the games, make sure to read the [Instructions for Competitors and Spectators][3] as well. The script submissions will be commentated this year by these [expert judges and commentators][4].

The full schedule, for both tracks (beginners and advanced), is available [HERE][5]. Be sure to check the [Scripting Games Announcement Channel][6] for the most up-to-date information.
