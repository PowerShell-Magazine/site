I was recently featured on the [Latest Shiny Podcast](https://l8istsh9y.com/) ([@l8istsh9y](https://twitter.com/l8istsh9y)) hosted by Rob Hirschfeld and Stephen Spector. I came across their podcast a while ago and listened to their [last two episodes](https://soundcloud.com/user-410091210). 

A few weeks ago Rob (I knew him from his Dell days) tweeted about a probable topic for an upcoming episode.

Having written a couple of published books on PowerShell DSC and being in the infrastructure automation space, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is close to my heart. Therefore, I just jumped in and said count me in! 

We started with a discussion on IaC but eventually it lead to Rob naming what we discussed as a vision for the continuously integrated data center! Indeed, that is (should be) the goal. Rest is what you will hear in this episode of the podcast.

This was a fun episode. Let me know what your thoughts are. I will certainly find some time to write about this vision and the objectives.
