The <a href="http://www.2013mms.com/" title="MMS 2013" target="_blank">MMS 2013</a> conference starts next week. The keynote and sessions will be available for replay through the Channel 9 web site. Channel 9 has unveiled <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/MMS/2013" title="The Channel 9 MMS 2013 page" target="_blank">their MMS 2013 page</a> including an <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/MMS/2013/RSS" title="Channel 9's MMS 2013 RSS Feed" target="_blank">RSS feed</a>. We can use the RSS feed and PowerShell to easily browse the session catalog. 

The following command uses the _Invoke-RestMethod_ cmdlet, introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0, to get information from the MMS 2013 RSS feed. We select a few properties and pass them on to the _Out-GridView_ cmdlet. In a grid view, we can perform further filtering (picking up only sessions where a summary contains the word &#8220;powershell&#8221;, for example), select the sessions we are interested in, and, thanks to a new _-PassThru_ parameter, pipe them to the _Export-Csv_ cmdlet. 

<pre class="brush: powershell; title: ; notranslate" title="">PS&gt; $rss = 'http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/MMS/2013/RSS'
PS&gt; Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $rss | select Title, Creator, Summary, Link | Out-GridView -PassThru | Export-Csv -Path c:\temp\mms2013.csv -Encoding UTF8
</pre>

This is how the grid view looks like after filtering PowerShell-related sessions (click for larger image):

Now that we have our sessions exported to a CSV file, we can import the file, and look at the details of some specific session that we are interested in:

```
PS> Import-Csv c:\temp\mms2013.csv | where title -match 'azure' | fl *
