Kirk Munro a.k.a @Poshoholic [announced][1] his departure from Quest on July 28th. Kirk has been very instrumental in several releases of [PowerGUI][2]. He is a very active member of community and helps people learn a lot. On September 6th, Kirk [announced][3] that he is joining DevFarm as a product manager for their PowerWF and PowerSE products. Here is an excerpt from Kirk&#8217;s announcement.

> This really represents how I have felt since my departure from my last job as Product Manager for PowerGUI.  I really love PowerShell as a technology, but as great as that technology is, it just wouldn’t be the same without the community that surrounds it.  PowerShell is blessed to have a tremendous community, and I am very, very proud to be able to continue to participate in that same community as a Product Manager for some really cool products that use PowerShell, as a PowerShell MVP, and as a geek who fell in love with technology a long time ago.
> 
> Now that I’ve found my new direction and focus, it’s time to get down to business.  Whether you’re a current user of <a href="http://powerwf.com/" target="_blank">PowerWF</a> or <a href="http://powerwf.com/products/powerse.aspx" target="_blank">PowerSE</a> or someone who is interested in trying<a href="http://powerwf.com/" target="_blank">PowerWF</a> or <a href="http://powerwf.com/products/powerse.aspx" target="_blank">PowerSE</a>, I’d love to connect with you to hear what you like (or don’t like) about these products as well as what you would like to see added to them in the future.

Good luck, Kirk.
