Here&#8217;s another cool project created by PowerShell MVP [Doug Finke][1]. [PSharp][2] is a tool designed for PowerShell&#8217;s Integrated Scripting Environment (ISE) editor.Â Its fast navigation capabilities allows you to quickly identify the functions, variables and commands in the current file, with a simple key stroke.

When you have a long script it is hard to know where exactly a variable or a function is located within the script. With PSharp, you can press _Ctrl+Shift+T_ and get a window that displays where those calls are made and you can easily navigate through them with the up or down arrows.

And that&#8217;s only a part of what it&#8217;s capable of. For more information go to the project page on [GitHub][2].
