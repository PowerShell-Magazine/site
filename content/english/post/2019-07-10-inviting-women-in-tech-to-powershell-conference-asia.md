I have been talking to several automation engineers (for a vacant position) and realized there are many women who have been doing some great work in the area of infrastructure automation. However, there have been very few women attendees or speakers at our user group meetings or conferences that I attended. 

While there may be many reasons for this, the organizing committee of PowerShell Conference Asia decided that we invite women in tech (infrastructure automation, Cloud, and DevOps) to this year&#8217;s edition of our conference. 

We have opened up [registration of intent to attend](http://bit.ly/psconfwomenintech) the conference. All you have to do is just provide your details. We will select five random registrations and give them full 3 day pass to the conference at no cost. For five more, we will offer higher discount. The organizing committee will decide the percentage of discount.

> The free entry or the discounted entry entails you the conference pass only. If you need to travel to Bangalore to attend this conference, attendee must bear the travel and accommodation expenses.


This registration will end on 15th August 2019. We will announce the selected registrations on 20th August 2019. 

Please share this registration information and help us enable women in the infrastructure automation, cloud, and DevOps space to attend PowerShell Conference Asia 2019!
