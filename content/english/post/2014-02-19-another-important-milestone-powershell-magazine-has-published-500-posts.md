You are reading the 500th post on PowerShell Magazine. Wow, what a journey! We had our share of ups and downs but kept this going for a good reason. And, that reason is you&#8211;the PowerShell community. This is indeed a great journey.

PowerShell Magazine was started back in 2011 as a platform to bring the Windows PowerShell community together to help each other in learning and sharing knowledge. To me, we have been really successful in that. So far, we [featured 59 authors][2] from this enthusiastic and energetic community. We published articles that are quoted at many places. We have had more than a million visits so far and counting. On our best days, we have close to 5K visits.

Some of our best posts received close to or more than 20K views. Here are the top 5!

| [5 Essential PowerShell Skills for Exchange Server Administrators](/211/12/20/5-essential-powershell-skills-for-exchange-server-administrators/) |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Provisioning and Licensing Office 365 Accounts with PowerShell](/2012/04/23/provisioning-and-licensing-office-365-accounts-with-powershell/) |
| [Windows PowerShell 3.0 and Server Manager Quick Reference Guides](/2012/06/09/windows-powershell-3-0-and-server-manager-quick-reference-guides/) |
| [Managing Group Policy with PowerShell](/2012/05/14/managing-group-policy-with-powershell/) |
| [Creating and configuring a SharePoint 2013 search service application](/2013/04/29/creating-and-configuring-a-sharepoint-2013-search-service-application/) |

Our social media outreach has been good too. We have close to 3K followers on [Twitter][3] and more than 1400 friends liked us on [Facebook][4].

If we have to improve one thing, that is the post frequency. We have had a few months when we published almost every day. This is something we have to do continuously. We have the [most active PowerShell tips][5] series but that alone does not help. PowerShell is an ocean and I don&#8217;t think we have even covered a small portion of it.

We have certainly slowed down a bit but we are picking up steam which means we have a good set of articles already in the queue waiting to get published. If you are interested in joining us on this journey, please feel free to [contact us][6].

I am eagerly waiting for our 1000th post and 2 million visitors! I am sure that day is not too far away. We want to take this opportunity to thank each one of you for being with us and supporting us. Thanks to [our sponsors][7] for helping us in this journey.

A big thank you from the [editorial team][8]!
