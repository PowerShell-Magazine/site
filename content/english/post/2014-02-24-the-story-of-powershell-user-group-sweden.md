<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">My name is Fredrik Wall and I’m a co-founder/co-leader of the PowerShell User Group Sweden. We have almost 530 members in our Facebook group and some more members who do not want to be on Facebook. </span>

The user group with its current name will turn 2 years on March 3 as a group on [Facebook][1]. On the 3 of March 2012, Niklas Goude, Niklas Åkerlund, and I started the PowerShell User Group Sweden on Facebook. That was a restart of the old user group “Scandinavia PowerShell User Group” that Niklas Goude, Magnus Lindegren, and I started sometimes before Microsoft TechDays in 2009.

That group was intended to be a PowerShell group for Scandinavia but was more or less a Swedish group and back then the group was small without a real platform to reach out to new members. So we decided to restart the group in 2012 as a Swedish group with Facebook as the platform to gather our members. It’s easy to handle and easy for our members to join.

In 2012 we were about 200 members and we had one meeting in Stockholm where the Microsoft Scripting Guy (Ed Wilson) visited us and talked about PowerShell. Last year we had 3 events:

- PowerShell Community Day 2013 in Stockholm (May 23)

  - Speakers:
    - Niklas Åkerlund, Niklas Goude, Daniel Sörlöv, Fredrik Wall, Fredrik Jonsson, and Johan Åkerström
