Some PowerShell wallpapers I created over the years to decorate my desktop and wanted to share them with you. If you have some of your own that you want to share with the community, send them over and we&#8217;ll add them to this page. Have fun ðŸ™‚

You can download a zip archive of all wallpapers [here](/downloads/powershell-wallpapers.zip).

Check out this awesome wallpaper onÂ [****Jason Helmick&#8217;s blog][2]. Thanks to PowerShell MVP Sean Kearney you can also get it as a Win7 Theme pack!
