We concluded the first exclusive PowerShell conference in Asia a couple of weeks ago. It was very successful and there are already plans to take this conference around APAC region. We have had PowerShell experts from around the world joining us as speakers at this conference. I had a chance to sit with some of them and talk to them about PowerShell, of course!

Today, Ferdinand Rios, CEO, SAPIEN Technologies talks to us about many things around PowerShell, PowerShell Studio, and the community.
