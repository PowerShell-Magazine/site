Microsoft has updated the [Quick Reference Guides page][1] with a new PDF guide: WMI and CIM quick reference. The two pageÂ guide describes differences between Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) in Windows PowerShell 2.0 and 3.0. It includes examples of how to find namespaces and classes in WMI, detailed information about CimSession, CimInstance, CIM operations, and invoking a CIM method. The quick reference describes how to get a list of new CIM cmdlets, and defines associations, WQL, WS-Man, WinRM, and CIM indications.
