Just when I was thinking that there is a need for a nice regular expression helper for PowerShell, SAPIEN Technologies announced the community preview of their [new product called PowerRegEx][1]. PowerRegEx is a regular expression building tool that provides help and real-time testing.

As per the SAPIEN announcement, the key features available in this community preview of PowerRegEx are:

  * Makes regular expression creation and discoverability easier, by grouping RegEx constructs by category.
  * Provides descriptions and examples on how to use each regular expression construct.
  * Includes sample regular expressions for Email, IP Address, and more.
  * Ability to test regular expresses against an existing file or ad-hoc text.
  * Export matches or non-matching lines.
  * Export regular expressions for PowerShell use.

Go ahead and [download the community preview][2]. It&#8217;s free!
