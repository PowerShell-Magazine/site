Windows Management Framework 5.0 Preview September 2014 was [released][1] on September 4.

An overview of new features added since the May 2014 Preview is listed in the [announcement][1] on the Windows PowerShell Team blog, while additional details are available in the [release notes][2].

There are also some new features not mentioned in the release notes, which we will look at in this article.

### Remote File Editing in PowerShell ISE

This feature allows us to edit remote files via PowerShell remoting from the PowerShell ISE.

To use Remote File Editing, open a new PSSession using `Enter-PSSession` and type `PSEdit <path to a file>`. Here is an example:

We can see that the file we&#8217;re editing is actually temporary stored in the local AppData folder:

![](/images/WMF5_Preview_2014_Sept_PSEdit_path.png)

Looking at the contents of the _PSEdit_ function, we can see that the file content is retrieved in byte format before it&#8217;s brought back and forth between the local ISE session and the remote PS session:

This can be a very useful feature for working with remote files, especially against Server Core.

### Throttling in Desired State Configuration

A new â€“ThrottleLimit parameter is introduced for 10 commands in the PSDesiredStatedConfiguration module:

This parameter enables control over how many nodes to process concurrently; a very useful feature when working with a large number of DSC clients.

### Start-Transcript support in PowerShell ISE

Historically the Start-Transcript cmdlet has been supported in the PowerShell Console Host only. If you try to use it in a PowerShell ISE version prior to &#8220;5.0 Preview September 2014&#8221; you will be presented with the message &#8220;This host does not support transcription&#8221;.

Introduced in the Windows Management Framework 5.0 Preview September 2014, Start-Transcript works in the PowerShell ISE:

**Improvements in COM object performance**

Major performance improvements for working with COM objects is introduced in this release. PowerShell team member Lee Holmes has published a [video][3] demonstrating the improvement.
