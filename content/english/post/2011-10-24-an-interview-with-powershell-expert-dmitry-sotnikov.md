During the PowerShell Deep Dive at [The Experts Conference][1] (TEC) Europe 2011 in Frankfurt, Germany, [Aleksandar Nikolic][2], one of the editors of the PowerShell Magazine, conducted a series of short video interviews with PowerShell experts. All of them were asked the same three questions:

  1. What is your favorite feature in PowerShell v3?
  2. Is there anything that you are still missing in PowerShell?
  3. How do you see the future of PowerShell and what could be done to ensure faster adoption of PowerShell?

As you can see, he&#8217;s cheated a little, and asked them four questions. ðŸ˜‰

We hope you will enjoy the interviews as much as we have enjoyed being at the first European PowerShell Deep Dive conference.

Starting today, we will post one video interview per day. Â The first one is with [Dmitry Sotnikov][3].
