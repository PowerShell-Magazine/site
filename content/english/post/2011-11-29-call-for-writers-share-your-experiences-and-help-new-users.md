PowerShell Magazine is starting a series of posts with personal stories about people&#8217;s PowerShell beginnings entitled &#8220;How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Windows PowerShell&#8221;.

We would like to hear about your first days with PowerShellâ€”how hard/easy it was to start using it, the biggest issues, why have you looked at PowerShell in the first place, the resources that you used in the beginning of the learning curve&#8230;. You don&#8217;t need to be an expert to participate and write this kind of article. Quite the opposite, we welcome stories from users with all levels of experience. You do not need any previous writing experience. ðŸ™‚

One thing is for sureâ€”new users will appreciate your effort. Let&#8217;s face it, PowerShell was once a completely new tool for all of us.

Thanks to [TrainSignal](http://www.trainsignal.com/default.aspx), an award-winning provider of computer-based training courses for IT professionals, we have prepared some nice prizes for you. One out of ten PowerShell community writers (PowerShell MVPs and Microsoft employees are not eligible for getting prizes) will be able to choose one of TrainSignal&#8217;s PowerShell courses:
