Have you tried PowerShell vNext included as a part of Windows 8 client and server developer preview? Don&#8217;t have a Windows 8 system to look at it just yet?

Don&#8217;t worry! Microsoft [just announced the release][1]  of Windows Management Framework 3.0 CTP1 build. This includes PowerShell vNext. This package also contains updated WMI and WinRM components. This release can be installed on Windows 7 SP1 and Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1. The below list &#8212; from the release page &#8212; shows some of the improvements or additions to PowerShell in this release.

### Windows PowerShell 3.0

Some of the new features in Windows PowerShell 3.0 include:

  * **Workflows**
  
    Workflows that run long-running activities (in sequence or in parallel) to perform complex, larger management tasks, such as multi-machine application provisioning. Using the Windows Workflow Foundation at the command line, Windows PowerShell workflows are repeatable, parallelizable, interruptible, and recoverable.
  * **Robust Sessions**
  
    Robust sessions that automatically recover from network failures and interruptions and allow you to disconnect from the session, shut down the computer, and reconnect from a different computer without interrupting the task.
  * **Scheduled Jobs**
  
    Scheduled jobs that run regularly or in response to an event.
  * **Delegated Administration**
  
    Commands that can be executed with a delegated set of credentials so users with limited permissions can run critical jobs
  * **Simplified Language Syntax**
  
    Simplified language syntax that make commands and scripts look a lot less like code and a lot more like natural language.
  * **Cmdlet Discovery**
  
    Improved cmdlet discovery and automatic module loading that make it easier to find and run any of the cmdlets installed on your computer.
  * **Show-Command**
  
    Show-Command, a cmdlet and ISE Add-On that helps users find the right cmdlet, view its parameters in a dialog box, and run it.
