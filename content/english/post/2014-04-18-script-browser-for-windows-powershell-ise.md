<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Microsoft has released a new ISE add-on, developed by Microsoft Customer Services & Support (CSS) team,  that enables you to </span>easily<span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> search and download scripts </span>from  the  TechNet Script Center, from within the scripting environment.

The [_Script Browser_][1] add-on is  bundled with a new experimental function: _Script Analyzer_. _Script Analyzer_ uses the PowerShell Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to check your current script against some predefined rules.

For more information, refer to the [official announcement on the PowerShell Team blog][2].

**Note:** There&#8217;s a known issue on some non-_en-US_ systems. See [this page][3] for a workaround. Microsoft&#8217;s confirmed the issue and an update should be released soon.

If you encounter any problems or have any suggestions, you can report them to onescript@microsoft.com.
