Are you looking at writing your own DSC resources? Have you been following [our DSC articles][1]? DSC is the exciting new feature in Windows PowerShell 4.0. To add to this excitement, PowerShell team has a holiday gift for all of us. [DSC Resource Kit Wave-1][2]! ðŸ™‚

This resource kit has a bunch of custom DSC resources. You may or may not use all of them but looking at the source is a great way of learning how to write your own DSC resources. 

You can download these custom resources from [TechNet script gallery][3].
