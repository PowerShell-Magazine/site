I am very happy to announce that [Bartek Bielawski][1] joined the PowerShell Magazine editorial board. Bartek is a multi-year recipient of Microsoft MVP award for Windows PowerShell. Bartek works at [Optiver][2] as a Windows Engineer and needless to say, he loves PowerShell. I have known Bartek for more than 5 years and have been following his blog posts for a long time. If you have not already read about OMI and Linux, Bartek is the only PowerShell MVP who had [written a series of articles on OMI][3] and how PowerShell can be used to manage Linux systems. There are many such examples of his expertise in not just PowerShell but many aspects of Windows OS and management. I learned a lot from him over years and will continue to in the years forward.

I have had the pleasure to personally meet Bartek at TEC 2011 in Germany and I am very happy to have him join us here at the PowerShell Magazine. He has already been an active [contributor at PowerShell Magazine][4] and I am also happy to announce that he decided to [write exclusively here][5]. Thank you Bartek and we are looking forward to great content from you as usual!
