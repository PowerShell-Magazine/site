Windows PowerShell workflows consist of a set of activities that run in sequence or in parallel and perform long-running, complex management tasks, such as multimachine application provisioning. Using the Windows Workflow Foundation at the command line, Windows PowerShell workflows are repeatable, parallelizable, interruptible, and recoverable.

The PowerShell team has published the “Getting Started with Windows PowerShell Workflow” document on [the CTP2 download page](http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=27548 ) (look for “WMF3 CTP2 Windows PowerShell Workflow.pdf”). This document will get you started with this newest addition to PowerShell functionality (you can also find a link to the CTP2 page in the Downloads sidebar widget on our homepage).

Keep in mind that CTP2 is a pre-release version. Features and behavior are likely to change before the final release, so if you have any feedback please provide it via [PowerShell Connect](https://connect.microsoft.com/powershell).
