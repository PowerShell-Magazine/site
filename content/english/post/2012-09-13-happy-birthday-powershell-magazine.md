Last year, on this day, we [announced the launch][1] of PowerShell Magazine. It has been an interesting year. We are proud to say that we are the exclusive PowerShell online magazine and proud of what we have achieved so far!

Some highlights from last year are:

  * Published 160+ posts written predominantly by the PowerShell community members.
  * Posted a series of [video interviews][2] (from PowerShell Deep Dive, 2011 Europe & TechEd NA) of several PowerShell MVPs and other experts from the community. This was a huge hit!
  * Invited community members to write their [PowerShell learning experiences][3]. Our readers loved it!
  * First to cover [PowerShell 3.0 announcements][4] from BUILD conference.
  * Ran a series of [brain teaser columns][5]. They are still in the list of top posts.
  * Started a daily [PowerShell tips & tricks column][6]! Do check out, if you have not seen this already.
  * Partnered with Microsoft to develop [PowerShell 3.0 cheat sheets][7]! This was a great hit. If you have attended TechEd NA 2012 and TechEd Europe 2012, you must have got a print of these.
  * Covered [PowerShell news][8] from all corners of the world.

  Last but not least, we gathered a good reader base. We have 160, 000 visits so far with the day average recently reaching 1000 visits. On our busiest day, we have had more than 2000 visitors!

If I am not very happy about one thing, it would be the missing PDF or mobi version of the magazine. I wrote in the inaugural post that we will have a monthly downloadable PDF version of the magazine. This is something we have not done so far. We are working at this and is certainly on top of our TODO list. We are making slow progress towards this but nonetheless, we are making progress.

We are not a revenue generating or a profit center. We are neither hosted nor have a corporation supporting this initiative. We are just a [group of individuals][9] trying to bring the community together to help newbies learn PowerShell and spread the love for PowerShell. To me, this community means a lot. It is not about a single individual trying to force his/her intentions or interests. At PowerShell Magazine, we totally understand this and respect the community. Our contributors know this very well.

By the way , if you want to be a contributor, just head to &#8216;[Write for us][10]&#8216; and submit a proposal! And, if you have any feedback or suggestions, please use the [feedback form][11]. We would love to hear from you.

We want to take this opportunity to thank and congratulate the community members who made this venture a success. We look forward to strengthening this community and I am sure we have a great year ahead.

Happy Birthday, PowerShell Magazine!
