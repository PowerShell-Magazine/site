In the earlier parts of this [series](/categories/garuda), I introduced you to the concepts and design of Garuda framework. I demonstrated a proof-of-concept version of this at PowerShell Conference Europe. 

The recording of that session is available.

</div></figure> 

Instead of writing another article about how the POC works, I thought it is easier for you to see it in action.

I am working on a complete overhaul of the framework and will have a new version soon on [GitHub](https://github.com/rchaganti/garuda). Stay tuned!
