I am very happy to announce that [Jan Egil Ring][1] accepted to [join PowerShell Magazine][2]. Jan is a known personality in the Windows PowerShell and virtualization communities. He was one of our [contributing authors][3] too. He isÂ working as a Lead Architect on the Infrastructure Team at Crayon, Norway. I had the opportunity to meet Jan at The Experts Conference in Germany. We even had an [interview with him][4] published on PowerShell Magazine.

Jan is an active contributor of [DSC Resource Kit Community Edition][5] and blogs atÂ [blog.powershell.no][6]. Of course, he will now start writing here! ðŸ™‚ Jan recently spoke at NIC Conf about the [Desired State Configuration][7] feature in Windows. I recommend this talk to anyone who is getting started with DSC.

Once again, we are excited to have Jan onboard with us. Welcome Jan! This is certainly a step forward towards realizing the vision I&#8217;d [mentioned in my last editorial][8].
