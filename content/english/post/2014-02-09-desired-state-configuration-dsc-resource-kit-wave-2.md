Around Christmas time last year, PowerShell team released the [wave 1 of DSC resource kit][1]. This had good number of custom resources to manage Hyper-V virtual machines, IIS websites, and so on. The wave 2 of [custom DSC resources just got released][2]. This release too has some very interesting DSC resources. For example, this release includes SQL DSC resources to install and manage SQL servers, Active Directory-related resources and some improvements and bug fixes of the previously released resources.
