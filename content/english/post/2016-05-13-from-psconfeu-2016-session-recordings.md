Session recordings &#8211; both videos and screencasts &#8211; from PowerShell Conference Europe 2016 are now available. It may be a couple of days before all sessions appear in the playlist.

I know what my plans for the weekend are! I am really looking forward to all security related sessions that I missed. Both Jared and Will rocked these sessions.
