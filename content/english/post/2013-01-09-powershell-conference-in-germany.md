In the scenic setting of the Museum for Industrial and Social History in Oberhausen, Germany, the first German PowerShell Community Conference will take place on April 10 and 11, 2013.

Leading experts like Dr. Holger Schwichtenberg (MVP .NET Framework), Peter Monadjemi and Dr. Tobias Weltner (MVP PowerShell) will present topics from the field and development, and will be available for questions and discussions. A separate pre-conference prep course will be available for those who did not yet have the time to dive into PowerShell that much.

More information and booking is available at <a href="http://www.powershell.de/konferenz" target="_blank">www.powershell.de/konferenz</a>. Please note that this is a **German-speaking event**.
