[PowerShell Conference Asia][1] is back. After a successful last year, we are back with a really exciting line up of sessions and speakers. This time around, we have speakers from all around the world flying to Singapore and share their PowerShell experiences and expertise with our attendees. Speakers include several members of the Windows PowerShell team from Microsoft headquarters in Redmond and a strong line-up of MVPs, well-known international speakers, and community contributors. They&#8217;ll cover in-depth topics on the PowerShell language and how you can use PowerShell to automate the technologies you use every day.

From the PowerShell team, we will have [Angel Calvo][2], [Kenneth Hansen][3], [Hemant Mahawar][4], and [Jason Shirk][5]. This team has the history and expertise to cover every concept/topic within Windows PowerShell. There will be strong focus on using PowerShell to enable DevOps practices whether On Premises or in the cloud.

The main event runs on Friday (October 21<sup>st</sup>) and Saturday (October 22<sup>nd</sup>), but we also have a pre-conference day on Thursday (October 20<sup>th</sup>), where we will have some vendor-led workshops where you will have the opportunity to be introduced to and get hands on with tools and technologies in the DevOps and Automation space. If that&#8217;s not your thing, we have a 1 day PowerShell refresher crash course led by one of the best PowerShell trainers in the United States. All included in your ticket price. This is geared up to make sure you get the most from being a conference attendee.

Our full schedule on Friday ends with drinks and nibbles at a local bar and Saturday with a closing session. If you have travelled to Singapore, you can head right home on Sunday or some sightseeing and a follow up lunch with peers and speakers.

We have opened ticket sales for this event.
