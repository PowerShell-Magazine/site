Exciting times! On September 18-19 2015, we at the Singapore PowerShell User Group are planning to host the first PowerShell Conference Asia. This will be held at Microsoft Singapore. It will be a 2-day single track event (with breakout sessions) and we intend it to pave the way for larger events of this kind here in Asia. The organizing committee at the moment consists of Matt Hitchcock (PowerShell MVP), Milton Goh (PowerShell MVP), Benjamin Hodge (Singapore User Group Co-lead and Sydney lead) and Ravikanth Chaganti (PowerShell MVP).

In preparation, we are now looking for speakers and sponsors to help make this event happen.

### Call for Speakers

The focus of this conference is PowerShell as a technology in its own right and we would prefer topics to be relevant to the core of PowerShell. It&#8217;s OK to submit topics like &#8216;Managing AD with PowerShell&#8217; provided AD is more the bi-product to share transferable PowerShell knowledge. If the session is more product-related than PowerShell it will be a breakout topic from the main track. At the moment we would like to target the sessions at intermediate to slightly-advanced level, assuming that all attendees have foundation knowledge of PowerShell and scripting. We are interested in various topics so please submit and the most interesting ones will be selected.

We would love to have enthusiastic PowerShell people from all over Asia or indeed the world! You don&#8217;t have to be a PowerShell master, just love what you&#8217;re doing with PowerShell and want to share it with others. Speakers will receive free entry to the event, speaker T-shirt and will of course be coming to the Speakers Dinner and Closing Drinks. While we would love to be able to cover travel & accommodation, at the moment this is not within our plans. If budget allows, we may be able to subsidise hotels or provide couch-surfing arrangements with trusted hosts. However, at this time it is not guaranteed and would be best viewed as an investment in your own career (personal brand, networking, etc.) and to the PowerShell community. Please be prepared to plan and fund your own travel at this stage.

Call for speakers and sponsors is open now and closes on 14th June 2015. Speakers will be told within 3 weeks of submission or by 30th June (whichever comes first) if their session is selected so get in there quick!

### Call for Sponsors

We are looking for sponsors with a vested interest in PowerShell or automation technology in general. If you have a PowerShell or PowerShell-compatible product, some relevant training or resources to share then we would love to have you as our sponsors. IT service providers and technology recruiters are equally as important and welcome to associate with us.
