[Jim Christopher][1], a Windows PowerShell MVP and a founder of Code Owls LLC, [announced][2] the release of [SeeShell][3]—a toolkit to visualize the data from various sources such as WMI objects, performance counters, event logs, files, databases, system events, etc.

[SeeShell][3] includes over two dozen types of charts—from simple column graphs to polar scatter plots. The timeline visualization can quickly map data along a time or numeric axis. The grid visualization contains a compelling feature set, including sorting, multi-level grouping, data-aware filtering, and data-aware property summaries.

Go ahead and [try][4] SeeShell. And, when you want a full license, you can buy one over [here][5].
