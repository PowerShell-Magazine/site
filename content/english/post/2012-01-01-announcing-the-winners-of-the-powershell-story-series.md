A month ago, we started a [contestÂ ][1]for our readers to share their first PowerShell experience &#8212; their PowerShell story. Along with that, we have also announced that there were prizes to win! And, today, we have come to an end of publishing the first round of articles. The response to these articles was just amazing. We have had several people submit the article pitch &#8212; we published a few of them and saved the rest for round two.

Today, we are happy to announce the winners of the first round. These winners were chosen by a PowerShell script (no wonder!) and we have recorded the winner selection process in a video (view in full screen) and posted it on our [YouTube channel][2].

Happy New Year!
