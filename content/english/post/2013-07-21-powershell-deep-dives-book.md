It is intended for anyone with an interest in PowerShell. It covers core PowerShell concepts and other technologies that rely on PowerShell such as: SQL Server, WSUS, Active Directory, and more.

Cain, Jim Christopher, Adam Driscoll, Josh Gavant, Oisín Grehan, Jason Helmick, Jeffery Hicks, Don Jones, Ashley McGlone, Jonathan Medd, Ben Miller, Aleksandar Nikolić, James O&#8217;Neill, Arnaud Petitjean, Vadims Podans, Karl Prosser, Boe Prox, Matthew Reynolds, Mike Robbins, Donabel Santos, Richard Siddaway, Will Steele, Trevor Sullivan, and Jeff Wouters.
