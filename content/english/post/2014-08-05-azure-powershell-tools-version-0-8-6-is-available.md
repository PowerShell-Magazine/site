The [Azure PowerShell Tools][1] are updated very often. But, this [0.8.6 release][2], is special and has many features that I was looking forward to. This release has the newÂ Azure VM DSC extension cmdlets, non-interactive login using _Add-AzureAccount_, a new set of cmdlets for Windows Azure Pack, and so on.

  - Added Version parameter to generic service extension cmdlets
