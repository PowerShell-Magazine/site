Due to low adoption and usage of the pre-release versions of Script Explorer, [Microsoft has decided to take the project down][1], starting by removing the RC package from the Download Center.

The back-end script aggregation service used by Script Explorer will continue to operate for a few more months, allowing users to gradually migrate to another scripts sharing platform.
