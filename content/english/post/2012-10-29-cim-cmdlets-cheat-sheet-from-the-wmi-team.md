[Osama Sajid][1] from the Windows Management Infrastructure team blogged about two WMI cheat sheets created by the WMI team. The first cheat sheet contains information to get you started with the CIM cmdlets in PowerShell 3.0. This is the updated version of WMI\_CIM\_PowerShell_v3.pdf cheat sheet, one of the <a title="Windows Powershell 3.0 and Server Manager Quick Reference Guides" href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30002" target="_blank">Windows PowerShell 3.0 and Server Manager Quick Reference Guides</a>. The second one is created as a great quick reference for developers and PowerShell power users who are interested in building CIM-based cmdlets and WMI providers.
