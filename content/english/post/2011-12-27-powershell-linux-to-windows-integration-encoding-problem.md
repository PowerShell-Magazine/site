In my life I try to be on the edge of IT technology and if I find something interesting I try to be in touch with it. I&#8217;m a big fan of UNIX based systems and impressed by their reliability and flexibility. That is why I love Linux and Mac OS.

I realize that Windows is the third major system, itâ€™s still alive and used in most of companies around the world. Windows 7 looks better protected and much more reliable. So, I studied itÂ  and looked the new technologies it offered. The weak points in Windows were the reliability, security, virus protection and command line interface. I&#8217;m a big enthusiast of CLI (command line interface) on Linux systems and this article is dedicated to that.

The first time I heard about Windows PowerShell I said &#8220;Wow, that is crazy&#8221;. What a great idea, make the command line shell in Windows really powerful. I won&#8217;t compare it to UNIX bash here. It is clear that PowerShell gives system administrators the ability to automate their job and a way to control the Windows systems through slow network connections. That is great.

In addition to my CLI interests, I&#8217;m a big enthusiast of OS integration. Iâ€™ll explain what I mean. Usually in companies Iâ€™ve been at, there are offices with Windows 7 desktop computers and laptops. Some have Windows Servers or Linux. The companies who do design, advertisement, computer graphics, post-production or TV have all three systems in their network. That means: Mac OS, Linux, Windows 7 and even Windows XP.Â  Control and integration is a problem. I&#8217;m looking for technology which can help. PowerShell and SSHÂ  may make this happen.

Until now, Windows 7 didnâ€™t have SSHÂ  out of the box. It uses an outdated \`telnet&#8217; for console connections. Thanks to [@ShayLevy][1] for the tip on the PowerShell SSH Server from [/n Software][2]. It looks great for these types of integration. Plus, they have a free version with a one connection limit.

The problem I faced &#8211; we have a Russian version of Windows 7. That means if I try to connect it with SSHÂ  from Linux I get a question mark in PowerShell replies.

The problem is different locales. The Linux box has modern UTF-8, the Windows have their own WIN-1251 for the Russian language. So, PowerShell Server from /n Software translates the reply incorrectly encoded.

I solved this by tweaking the registry for PowerShell Server.

First, I need to make a new string parameter in \`HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE âžœ SOFTWARE âžœ PowerShellInsideÂ  âžœ PowerShellServer&#8217;. The \`WireEncoding&#8217; should be set to \`UTF-8&#8242;.

Then I run PowerShell server as a Windows Service, restart it, and connect throughÂ SSH again. It now works with the correct Russian responses.
