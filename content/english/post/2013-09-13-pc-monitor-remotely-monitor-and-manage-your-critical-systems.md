[][1]Mobile PC Monitor is an innovative solution for monitoring and managing  mission-critical  IT systems using  a secure mobile application that gives IT administrators complete control of their critical servers and applications from anywhere, anytime. It dramatically reduces the level of manual checks support engineers have to do on a daily basis and provides them with a real time status of their monitored systems.

The  mobile application is available on iOS,  Android, Windows  Phone, BlackBerry and Windows 8. A web-based application is also available with support for major web browsers. Integrated server modules offer in-depth management tools  for  popular server applications including Microsoft IIS Server , Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Exchange, Microsoft Hyper-V, VMware vSphere, Citrix Xen Server, Microsoft Active Directory, and Microsoft Windows Server Backup.

PC Monitor also offers a public API so that developers can integrate their own applications into the solution allowing you to add custom features.  They can either choose to create a plugin that is inserted right into the agent installed on each system or a cloud instance that is a mobile interface to their own .NET or Java application. The  agent support Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems.

One interested plugin I&#8217;ve found in the website forum was PowerOfTheShell. It allows you to run PowerShell scripts while you are on the go and get the results immediately from within PC Monitor directly on your mobile device. You can find more information about the plugin and its author [here][2].

PC Monitor is free for non-commercial use and you can monitor up to 5 computers or applications with no subscription payment required and no time limitation. To create an account you will need to download and install the PC software from <www.mobilepcmonitor.com> first. A quick setup guide is available on the web site.
