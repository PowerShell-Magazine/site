The [PowerShell Conference Asia][1] resumes for its 4th year this October, bringing speakers from Asia and around the world to deliver in-depth PowerShell and DevOps sessions. I am excited to be a part of this great event for another year and can&#8217;t wait to meet all my old friends and make a few new friends. I will be bringing over a few copies of my [Pro PowerShell Desired State Configuration][2] book to give away!

Jeffrey Snover, father of PowerShell, will be at this year&#8217;s conference and other speakers include the Microsoft PowerShell Product Team members from Redmond and a strong line-up of MVPs, well-known international speakers, and community contributors.&nbsp;They&#8217;ll cover in-depth topics on the PowerShell language and how you can use PowerShell to automate the technologies you use every day, both within the Microsoft technology stack and well beyond. There will be strong focus on using PowerShell to enable DevOps practices whether on-premises or in the cloud as well as Systems Administration and Security.

Our theme for this year will emphasize on the Open Source aspects of PowerShell development as we look to build an even stronger community engagement and contribution.&nbsp;The main event runs on Friday and Saturday, but we also have a pre-conference day on Thursday for hands-on workshops.&nbsp;At the end of Day 1 (Friday), we have drinks and nibbles at a local bar where you can connect with peers and the speakers in a more relaxed setting. All included in your ticket price. Remember, we still have another full day of content on Saturday though!

Similar to my PowerShell Conference EU 2018 PS Drive, I made one for browsing PS Conference Asia agenda as well. You can download the module from my GitHub repository&nbsp;<https://github.com/rchaganti/psconfasiadrive>.

Here is a quick snip of using this module.
