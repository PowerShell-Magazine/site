Not completely yet. But, the Visual Studio 2013 Update 2 RC release seems to be a step in that direction. This update includes PowerShell syntax highlighting in the Visual Studio Editor.

We still cannot select and add a PowerShell script as an item. Instead, I selected a text file and named it as .ps1 file.

The syntax highlighting is a feature built into the product and not an extension or add-on.Â So, I don&#8217;t see a reason why this won&#8217;t be available in the Express edition of Visual Studio.

PowerShell script debugging and IntelliSense are on top of my wish list for Visual Studio. I&#8217;d love to see other features such as ability to author script modules as a Visual Studio solution etc. These features may already be on their way into the product. Until then, I will go back to Windows PowerShell ISE!

You can download the VS 2013 Update 2 RC from [Microsoft download center][1].
