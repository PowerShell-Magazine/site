We concluded the first exclusive PowerShell conference in Asia a couple of weeks ago. It was very successful and there are already plans to take this conference around APAC region. We have had PowerShell experts from around the world joining us as speakers at this conference. I had the chance to sit with some of them and talk to them about PowerShell, of course!

Today, Girish Prakash, technologist at Dell talks to us about Dell&#8217;s PowerShell provider to manage business client BIOS settings and what he likes in PowerShell!
