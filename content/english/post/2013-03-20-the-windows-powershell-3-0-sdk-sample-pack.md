Microsoft has released the [Windows PowerShell 3.0 SDK Sample Pack][1]. The pack contains code samples that show how to build applications based on Windows PowerShell 3.0.

The code samples (C#) demonstrate how to use the Windows PowerShell 3.0 API to build a rich set of applications. The package contain code samples that show how to host the Windows PowerShell Workflow runtime, generate workflow activities from Windows PowerShell cmdlets and modules, disconnect and reconnect a Windows PowerShell session, support paging operations, and a number of other tasks that are possible with Windows PowerShell 3.0. It also includes samples from the Windows PowerShell 2.0 SDK.

You can download [individual samples][2]  or [all the samples][1] at once.

Note that in order to use the samples you&#8217;ll need to install the [Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows 8][3] which includes the reference assemblies for Windows PowerShell 3.0.
