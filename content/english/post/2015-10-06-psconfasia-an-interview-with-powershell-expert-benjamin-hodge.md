We concluded the first exclusive PowerShell conference in Asia a couple of weeks ago. It was very successful and there are already plans to take this conference around APAC region. We have had PowerShell experts from around the world joining us as speakers at this conference. I had the chance to sit with some of them and talk to them about PowerShell, of course!

Today, the second in this series, Benjamin Hodge, Technical Services Director at Kemp Technologies talking about how he started with PowerShell, what he likes the most in PowerShell, and how beginners can get started with PowerShell.
