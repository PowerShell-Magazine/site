During the PowerShell Deep Dive atÂ [The Experts Conference][1]Â (TEC) Europe 2011 in Frankfurt, Germany,Â [Aleksandar Nikolic][2], one of the editors of the PowerShell Magazine, conducted a series of short video interviews with PowerShell experts. All of them were asked the same three questions:

  1. What is your favourite feature in PowerShell v3?
  2. Is there anything that you are still missing in PowerShell?
  3. How do you see the future of PowerShell and what could be done to ensure faster adoption of PowerShell?

As you can see, he&#8217;s cheated a little, and asked them four questions. ðŸ˜‰

We hope you will enjoy the interviews as much as we have enjoyed being at the first European PowerShell Deep Dive conference.

The PowerShell ExpertsÂ [video series][3]Â continues with the interview with Bruce Payette, Principal Developer with the PowerShell product team and the man behind the most famous PowerShell book &#8212; Windows PowerShell in Action! In this video, Bruce shared his views on PowerShell v3 and the future of PowerShell.
