Editor Aleksandar Nikolic caught up with Darren Mar-Elia, the CTO and founder of SDM Software & <GPOGUY.com>, at [MMS 2012][1]. Darren has been a Microsoft MVP in Group Policy technology for the last 8 years, and has written and spoken on Active Directory, Group Policy and PowerShell topics around the world. You&#8217;ll hear Darren talking about managing Group policy with PowerShell and how his PowerShell-based products have filled in a gap left even after Microsoft introduced Group Policy module with Windows Server 2008 R2. He&#8217;s talked briefly about his Group Policy-related session at MMS 2012 and announced &#8220;Best Practices for Designing and Consolidating Group Policy for Performance and Security&#8221; (<http://northamerica.msteched.com/topic/details/2012/WSV206#fbid=qtp3Ihr8FLm>) session that he&#8217;s preparing for TechEd NA in Orlando.
