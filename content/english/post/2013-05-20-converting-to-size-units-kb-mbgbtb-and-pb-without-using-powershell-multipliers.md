Hello everyone! After some time, here is the brand new brain teaser. We hope you will like the challenge. ðŸ™‚ 

In PowerShell, we can convert from bytes to KB, MB, GB, TB, and PB using the multipliers. For example,

<pre class="brush: powershell; title: ; notranslate" title="">$size = 123456789
$size / 1KB
$size / 1MB
$size / 1GB
$size / 1TB
$size / 1PB
</pre>

Now, here is a task for you. You need to find a way to perform the above conversion **without using any of the above PowerShell multipliers that is KB, MB, GB, TB, and PB**. Here are some more rules:

1. If the result contains decimal point, round the number down. For example: 12.99 should become 12.
  
2. All versions of PowerShell are allowed, shortest way wins.
