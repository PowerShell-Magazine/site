PowerShell Conference Asia 2019 was a huge success. The attendee turnout was never like before. We had 200+ attendees and speakers worldwide spend three days in Bangalore to share their PowerShell expertise. We wanted to make it much more significant with the 2020 edition, but unfortunately, the pandemic washed away our ambitions.

Although we still cannot do an in-person event in 2021, we are looking at a two-day, multi-track, multi-technology conference. Apart from PowerShell, we are expanding to DevOps and cloud tracks as well. Within DevOps and cloud tracks, we are not limiting to Microsoft technologies alone. With enterprises focusing on multi-cloud infrastructure, learning across different cloud platforms and DevOps tools becomes critical for IT professionals and developers. This diversification opens up more opportunities for the attendees to learn and network.
