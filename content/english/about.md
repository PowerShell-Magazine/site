The PowerShell community itself is very strong with several sources of information such as MVP & community blogs, podcasts, and open source PowerShell modules and extensions. There are also several technical magazines providing PowerShell content in bits and pieces. The &#8220;PowerShell Magazine&#8221; was started with a thought of serving exclusive PowerShell content free of cost to the readers. Our magazine is a monthly magazine and is available as an online edition and as downloadable PDF (and ePub/Mobi formats in future). The majority of content contribution is done through guest authors and the community. A few selected guest authors will be rewarded for the content either in cash or other means. If you are interested in writing for us, you may [submit an article pitch here](/write-for-us/).

### Editorial Panel

Our editorial team includes several Microsoft MVPs in PowerShell, crossing disciplines between software development and systems administration, as well as long time PowerShell community members. We will leverage our own skills, as well as those of the community we interact with to drive topics, content, and areas of focus. You can reach our editorial team at: Ravikanth@Ravichaganti.com.
